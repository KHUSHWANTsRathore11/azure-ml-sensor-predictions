# DEPRECATED: Release Pipeline No Longer Used
#
# With the new branching strategy, all deployments are handled in build-pipeline.yml:
#   - develop branch: Promotes to Registry after training
#   - release/* branch: Deploys from Registry to Test
#   - main branch: Deploys from Registry to Production
#
# This file is kept for reference only.
# See: build-pipeline.yml for current deployment logic
